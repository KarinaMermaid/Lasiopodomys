## The search of association with reproductive isolation in narrow-headed vole

Narrow-headed vole *Lasiopodomys gregalis* (Cricetidae, Rodentia) is a widespread species inhabiting Palearctic realm. Recently it was shown that South-East of the Zabaykalskii Region and Eastern Mongolia populations represent cryptic species - *Lasiopodomys raddei*. Experimental crossing of *L. raddei* and *L. gregalis* do not result in any progeny, while control sample of conspecifics successfully reproduced (Petrova et al., 2016).
